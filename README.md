# Let's Go Out

For this project, I plan to create a GUI that lets users input different parameters for what they want to do on a date night. The app will take these responses to recommend date ideas. 
These date ideas can range from restaurants to movies to experiences. 

I will have to create a CSV file in Excel that the code in Python will use to give the date ideas. The file will contain all the restaurant and other event info.

Name: Let's Go Out
